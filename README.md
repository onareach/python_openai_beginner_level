# Prompt Engineering: A Practical Example

This repository contains a practical example to showcase a few common prompt engineering techniques. It's the codebase used in the associated Real Python tutorial on [practical prompt engineering](https://realpython.com/practical-prompt-engineering/). The project allows you to preprocess customer service chats using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using the OpenAI API.

## Setup

Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

You can generate your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) in your OpenAI account settings.

## Install

Create and activate a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/). Then install the `openai` dependency:

```bash
(venv) $ python -m pip install openai
```

Or, to make sure that you're using the same versions as shown in the tutorial, you can install from `requirements.txt` instead:

```bash
(venv) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Read support chat conversations from a file, sanitize the text, classify by sentiment, and format the output as JSON:

```bash
(venv) $ python app.py chats.txt
```

You can also provide a different file as your input file.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- [LICENSE](LICENSE): License information
- [README.md](README.md): Information on the project and how to use it
- [app.py](app.py): Code logic
- [chats.txt](chats.txt): Customer support chats used for building few-shot examples
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt): Project requirements
- [sanitized-chats.txt](sanitized-chats.txt): Sanitized version of `chats.txt` that's used for building few-shot examples for sentiment analysis
- [sanitized-testing-chats.txt](sanitized-testing-chats.txt): Sanitized version of `testing-chats.txt` that's used for testing the prompt used for sentiment analysis
- [settings.toml](settings.toml): Main settings file used for iteratively improving the prompts
- [settings-final.toml](settings-final.toml): Final state of the settings file at the end of the tutorial
- [testing-chats.txt](testing-chats.txt): Customer support chats used for testing the prompt on new data

You can find more information about when and how to use the different files [in the tutorial](https://realpython.com/practical-prompt-engineering/).

## Prompts

Change the prompts used in the script by editing the entries in [`settings.toml`](settings.toml). The repository also contains a second settings file, [`settings-final.toml`](settings-final.toml), which contains the prompts that you use in the [final section](https://realpython.com/practical-prompt-engineering/#improve-your-output-with-the-power-of-conversation) of the tutorial.

While working through the tutorial, you'll learn how to improve your text completions by iteratively developing the prompt. You'll make these changes to your prompt based on a few prompt engineering techniques. Here you'll find a collection of all the prompts that you use throughout the tutorial:

### Zero-Shot Prompting

```toml
[prompts]
instruction_prompt = """
Remove personally identifiable information, only show the date,
and replace all swear words with "ðŸ˜¤"
"""
```

### One-Shot Prompting

```toml
[prompts]
instruction_prompt = """
Remove personally identifiable information, only show the date,
and replace all swear words with "ðŸ˜¤"

Example Input:
[support_tom] 2023-07-24T10:02:23+00:00 : What can I help you with?
[johndoe] 2023-07-24T10:03:15+00:00 : I CAN'T CONNECT TO MY BLASTED ACCOUNT
[support_tom] 2023-07-24T10:03:30+00:00 : Are you sure it's not your caps lock?
[johndoe] 2023-07-24T10:04:03+00:00 : Blast! You're right!

Example Output:
[Agent] 2023-07-24 : What can I help you with?
[Customer] 2023-07-24 : I CAN'T CONNECT TO MY ðŸ˜¤ ACCOUNT
[Agent] 2023-07-24 : Are you sure it's not your caps lock?
[Customer] 2023-07-24 : ðŸ˜¤! You're right!

### Few-Shot Prompting
